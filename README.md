# inverse-SG
This repo is for inverse SG games related test scripts. We focus on
- discrete state discrete action games
- static and dynamics games

Continuous state continuous actions are not considered for now.

## Test scripts
- `inverse_lp_test.m` estimates the objective parameter using observed optimal solution.
- `inverse_sg_static_test.m` estimates the follower's cost matrix in a static SG game.
